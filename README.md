# Operationalizing Predictive Analytics to Improve Appointment Management in the Home Remodeling Industry

This project is the Capstone Project completed at Purdue University by our team.

## Project Overview

This study examines and tests several supervised learning methodologies to predict and maximize appointment conversions. The research is motivated by the significant costs incurred due to no-shows and inefficient scheduling, which is a common challenge across the home remodeling industry and beyond.

By leveraging predictive analytics, we aim to optimize appointment management, reduce cancellations, and improve overall operational efficiency for home remodeling businesses.

## Features

- Implementation of multiple supervised learning algorithms for appointment conversion prediction
- Comparative analysis of different machine learning methodologies
- Real-world data collection and preprocessing from the home remodeling industry
- Actionable insights and recommendations for operational improvement

## Technologies Used

- Python (Data analysis and modeling)
- scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- pandas, numpy (Data manipulation)
- Jupyter Notebook (Prototyping and analysis)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

## Results
Developed predictive models that significantly improve appointment conversion rates.<br />
Provided industry partners with strategies for reducing no-shows and optimizing schedules.<br />
Insights can be adapted to other appointment-based industries facing similar challenges.
